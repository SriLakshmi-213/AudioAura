# AudioAura

AudioAura is an AI-powered music analysis tool that detects genres and emotions in songs. It uses machine learning to scan audio files, classify musical styles, and interpret emotional tones.

## Features
- Upload and analyze audio files for genre and emotion detection
- Save and load trained genre models for efficient reuse
- Frontend built with React and Vite for fast development and deployment

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or FastAPI), ML libraries (Librosa, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- **Deployment**: Vite for frontend build and hot module replacement

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url
    cd AudioAura
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Training and Using Models

1. Navigate to the `my-react-app` directory and then to the `ml_code` folder:
    ```bash
    cd my-react-app/ml_code
    ```

2. Train your model using the provided Python script:
    ```bash
    python3 train_models.py
    ```
   This will save the trained models to the specified path.

3. Use the saved genre paths in your frontend for real-time music analysis.

## Running the Backend

1. After training the models, run the real-time analysis script:
    ```bash
    python3 realtime_analysis.py
    ```

## Running the Frontend

1. Open another terminal and navigate back to the `my-react-app` directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-react-app
    ```

2. Start the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
